## SIMPLE LAUNCHPAD

## How it works

Upload your own sounds, set key bindings and play!

-   Use defined `Key` or click button to play a sound.
-   Use `Escape` to stop all sounds.

## Development

This is next.js app bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
